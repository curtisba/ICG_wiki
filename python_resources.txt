Python Resources
By: Shelby Williams

Below is a list of resources that I used when learning python. Please feel free to update this list with other resources that you find!

**Learn Python the Hard Way**

This book exists in PDF format somewhere on the web. I haven't added a link because the book author keeps changing where they provide the free version.

This is a great introduction to python and programming as a whole! It will get you comfortable with typing and checking your code for errors.


**Codecademy**
www.codecademy.com

Highly interactive, engaging and fun! A great way to begin to understand how code works and to reinforce the basics.

**EdX**

Learn the basics, and then begin to apply your knowledge to real-world problems!

**Coursera**

Another great lecture series designed to explain how code is working. Lots of helpful assignments to get you thinking about how to apply your problem-solving skills.

Now that you know the basics of python, try to apply your knowledge to common biological problems! Note: these problems get really challenging!
