**SPOCK** is a thorough gene annotation and manual curation pipeline. Traditional functional annotation methods tend to underestimate genes or incorrectly assign genes especially for highly divergent sequences. SPOCK gathers data from various databases, find functional profiles of proteins, and use phylogeny to "rank" gene annotations.
