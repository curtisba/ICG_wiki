Extracting protein or nucleotide sequences from an assembly using a GFF file

You will need a gff3 file and the genome assembly it is based on.

To get the protein sequences of the genes identified in the gff3 file

/opt/perun/PASA_r20140417/misc_utilities/gff3_file_to_proteins.pl name_of_gff_file  name_of_assembly prot > name_of_outputfile

To get the nucleotide equivalent (coding sequence) of the protein sequence

/opt/perun/PASA_r20140417/misc_utilities/gff3_file_to_proteins.pl name_of_gff_file  name_of_assembly CDS > name_of_outputfile

To get the nucleotide equivalent (coding sequence) plus a certain amount of flanking sequence on both ends

/opt/perun/PASA_r20140417/misc_utilities/gff3_file_to_proteins.pl name_of_gff_file  name_of_assembly CDS number_of_flanking_bases > name_of_outputfile

To get the nucleotide gene sequence

/opt/perun/PASA_r20140417/misc_utilities/gff3_file_to_proteins.pl name_of_gff_file  name_of_assembly gene  > name_of_outputfile

Note that the number of gene sequences returned may not be equivalent to the number of protein or CDS sequences returned due to alternative
CDS/protein models

To get the nucleotide gene sequence plus a certain amount of flanking sequence

/opt/perun/PASA_r20140417/misc_utilities/gff3_file_to_proteins.pl name_of_gff_file  name_of_assembly gene number_of_flanking_bases > name_of_outputfile
