====Command Line Tips and Tricks====

The idea of this section is to share command line tips and tricks that you have found made it a lot easier to do bioinformatics work. This can range from basic UNIX things like setting up your terminal environment, configuring your SSH connections or managing your filesystem to explaining new bioinformatics tools and how to work with large scale computer clusters.
