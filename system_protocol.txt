**6. How to build a local server on Ubuntu?**

For example, you have a powerful local machine installed with Ubuntu system and you want to work at home without bringing it home. You can easily build a local server on the power machine and access it via your laptop at home by the following steps.

  * Step one: You need to sign up free account at ngrok. __ngrok__  https://ngrok.com/product provides a real-time web UI where you can introspect all HTTP traffic running over your tunnels. Replay any request against your tunnel with one click. 
  * Step two: ngrok can be downloaded via the link https://ngrok.com/download
  * Step three: decompress ngrok.zip and run it on your Ubuntu with the command:

<code>
./ngrok tcp 22
</code>

you will see something like this jumping out, which is important.

{{:server_11.33.40_am.png?nolink&400|}}

Error 1:
<code>
TCP tunnels are only available after you sign up.
Sign up at: https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup

If you have already signed up, make sure your authtoken is installed.
Your authtoken is available on your dashboard: https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken

ERR_NGROK_302
</code>

Solve 1: This will need you to sign up account at https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup, follow the installation and add your authtoken. 

Error 2
<code>
kex_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host
</code>

Solve 2: This will need you to install ssh server via the command:

<code>
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
</code> 

  * Step four: on your laptop(e.g., MacBook) run the command:

<code>
ssh ubuntu_user_account@4.tcp.ngrok.io -p11161

# here user_account_name is the user name of your ubuntu
# -p11161 is what appearing in the screenshot. The number varies with each login.
#Then it will ask you to fill in your password from your local powerful machine. The password is what you login your Ubuntu user account.
</code>

Now you should be able to remotely access your Lap computer even at home. Note, don't power off your lab computer if you want to use it as server. And if you unfortunately turn off the server, or electricity power off, you have to redo the four steps and the number will be changed.

Some other tips for data transferring: 

  * from lab_ubuntu to home_laptop  
<code>scp -P 11161 user_account_name@4.tcp.ngrok.io:/home/XXX/Desktop/server.png /Users/XXX/Desktop/ </code>

  * from home_laptop to lab_ubuntu 
<code>scp -P 11161  /Users/XXX/Desktop/22-you-got-this-meme-5.jpg user_account_name@4.tcp.ngrok.io:/home/XXX/Desktop/</code>

Transfer the raw fast5 files using an FTP client such as FileZilla ([[https://filezilla-project.org/]]) to your Perun account. This might take up to a day.

**7. How to use FileZilla?**

FileZilla is a free FTP solution for both client and server. FileZilla can be accessed via filling in the information as follows:
<code>
Host: sftp://perun.biochem.dal.ca
Username: your perun username
Password: your perun password
Port: defaulted as 22
</code>
