For running this script, you will need a fasta file and a phylogenetic tree. The names of fasta headers and tree branches MUST be identical.

please copy to your folder:

scp /home/dsalas/Shared/TreeSearches_DomainArchitecture/ETE_standAlone.py .

    To execute this program:
1) export the following paths (which you will easily do by copy and paste)
   unset PYTHONPATH
   export PATH=/scratch2/software/Python-2.7.13/bin:$PATH
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/scratch2/software/Python-2.7.13/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
2) Launch the program using the following command line:
   xvfb-run -a python ETE_standAlone.py <list_of_files_to_process>
   
   The format of list_of_files_to_process is: fastafile\ttreefile\n
   
 
the expected output is a pdf that will look like:

{{:example.jpg?400|}}
